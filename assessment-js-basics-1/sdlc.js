// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the team is supposed to figure out what the code is supposed to do / finding out its' requirements'."

const design = "This is the third step, in which the goal is to prototype how the software is going to work. There are many different aspects of design that are included in this process."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the team is writing and implementing the ideas created from the previous step."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which the goal is to test the function of the software that has been implemented on the previous step. This includes checking performance, and preventing any bugs or glitches that could be in the code."

const maintain = "This is the sixth and final step, in which the final goal is to find new errors that the user may encounter and to correct those on the way. Maintainence also includes coming up with new features and adding those to the software."
